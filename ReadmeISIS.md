# In this file We will explain the ISIS files in both folders Power Management System and Water Management System

In our project, we have implemented a series of components to manage and control the power supply to our devices:

1. **Rectifier**: This component is used to convert the fluctuating alternating current (AC) into a steady flow of direct current (DC). It also regulates the voltage from 220V down to 12V.

2. **DC Plug Terminal**: This terminal further reduces the voltage from 12V to 5V, ensuring a safe and stable power supply for our devices.

3. **Current Sensor**: This sensor is responsible for monitoring and calculating the current when our devices are in sleep mode. This allows us to track power consumption even when the devices are not actively in use.

4. **Relay**: The relay acts as a switch that can automatically shut down the current when our devices enter sleep mode. This helps to conserve energy and extend the lifespan of our devices.

5. **ESP32**: This is the microcontroller unit that connects our sensors and relay. It serves as the "brain" of our system, processing inputs from the sensors and controlling the relay based on these inputs.

By integrating these components, we have created a power management system that is both efficient and responsive, capable of adapting to the changing needs of our devices. This system not only conserves energy but also helps to prolong the operational lifespan of our devices.

In our project, we have incorporated two key sensors to enhance the functionality of our mobile app and provide valuable information to our users:

1. **Turbidity Sensor**: This sensor measures the cloudiness or haziness of water, which is an important indicator of water quality. The data generated by this sensor is sent to our mobile app, providing users with real-time updates about their water quality.

2. **Water Flow Sensor**: This sensor measures the flow rate of water. By analyzing the water flow data, users can detect if there are any leaks in their water circuit. This feature not only helps in conserving water but also in preventing potential water damage.

These sensors play a crucial role in our system, enabling users to monitor and manage their water usage effectively and efficiently. They contribute to a smarter and more sustainable water management solution.
